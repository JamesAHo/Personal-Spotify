# Personal Music App

## Description

As a music lover, I always want to keep up with the most recent album drops from my favorite artists. The best way to do this is to 
create a website that have all of the features I need. I have created this website as a simple application so I could search and listen to my favorite artists's new song.

## Table of Contents (Optional)
